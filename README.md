Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher algorithm in JavaScript. The Caesar Cipher, also known as the Shift Cipher, is a substitution cipher that shifts the letters of a message by a fixed number of positions to encrypt and decrypt text. This implementation provides functions for both encrypting and decrypting messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.

Features:
- Easy-to-use JavaScript functions for encrypting and decrypting messages with the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Supports customizable shift key values for encryption and decryption.
- Provides a sample input interface for users to interact with the Caesar Cipher functionality.

Usage:
1. Enter the plaintext message and specify the shift key value.
2. Click the "Encrypt" button to encrypt the message using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
3. The ciphertext will be displayed in the output field.
4. To decrypt the ciphertext, enter it in the plaintext field and specify the same shift key value used for encryption.
5. Click the "Decrypt" button to decrypt the ciphertext and recover the original message.

This repository serves as a learning resource and reference implementation of the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Feel free to explore the code, contribute improvements, or integrate it into your own projects.
